## 🧠 About Me

I’m an aspiring computer scientist with a strong interest in building impactful technology. I designed and developed SchoolNav, a full-stack navigation application that helps users find their way around large and complex buildings.

The idea came from recognizing how difficult it can be to navigate such spaces—especially for wheelchair users, who often can’t take the same routes as others. SchoolNav addresses this by providing routes that prioritize accessible paths (e.g., ramps) to the user’s chosen destination.

My work blends analytical thinking, creativity, and collaboration. I enjoy learning through real-world challenges and developing tools that improve and change lives tangibly.
